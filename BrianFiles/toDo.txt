ToDo:

MatlabNodeParser:
  -construct_node_container() was changed to created nodes for the original input nodes. Can this method be
   broken down into more manageable methods. Can it be made simpler?

AdjacencyMatrix:
  -final_max_inode saw some alterations with the change of construct_node_container in MatlabNodeParser.
   Do we still need final_max_inode its current state? Can it be simplified?
  -Can max_layer_node() and final_max_inode() be changed for efficiency? are they even still needed
  -Might be able to completely remove final_max_inode() as all nodes are now in _nodes

GUI thoughts:
  -All valid nodes show up around the circle but there is no connectivity shown.
  -You can click on any node and it will show the original inputs that it is connected to
  -The outputs and inputs should be represented in some unique way
