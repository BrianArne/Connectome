ToDo:

Graphing:
  Create a graph; g = Graph();
  Graphs have verticies (given id 0 - n); graph.add_verticies();
  Graphs have edges (id to id pair); graph.add_edges([(0,1), (1,2)]);
    Can probably just make a arr of pairs from the print(s_graph)


GUI thoughts:
  -All valid nodes show up around the circle but there is no connectivity shown.
  -You can click on any node and it will show the original inputs that it is connected to
  -The outputs and inputs should be represented in some unique way
