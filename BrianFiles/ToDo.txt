TODO:

*** Highest Priority ***
  1) Make drop down selection for region pairs in chord diagram - Done, different widget used.
  2) Recolor selected pairs from drop down in Surf Ice - Done, very basic and could be improved to better differentiate selections, tested using Surf Ice v1.0.20190518 w/ Legacy OpenGL (si_refresh.sh created to refresh Surf Ice, but currently uses 'xdotool', an easy X11 scripting interface; will eventually change to just use X11 itself to avoid the need of installing that library, just select Surf Ice and hit Ctrl+R to refresh).
  4) User interface to select .matlab file
  5) Clean up Connectome.py
    -Move button related things somewhere appropriate

*** Medium Priority ***
  1) Add edge in Surf Ice between node regions selected from drop down - Done, currently basic.
  2) Determine how ipython (jupyter), plotly.FigureWidge, and Plotly.graph_obs work together
  3) New file format parsers
  4) Matlab scripts to generate files
  5) Extract Class from Chord Graph
    -Graph
    -Gui
  6) Load time for Plotly
    -Probably related to loading in full Plotly.js script @ runtime
  7) Error checking
    -Zero nodes selected for redraw - currently if none selected, will draw whole graph; if unconnected output selected, will draw empty plot...
  8) Update testcases
  9) Do we want to redraw graph instead of creating another?

*** Low Priority ***
  1) Dependency manager to automatically load up dependencies
    -$pip -r requirements.txt (might do the trick)
  2) Add code coverage tool to see what has and hasn't been tested (Coverage.py)
  3) Move to Python 3.x - next objective to allow for file selection through ipywidget
