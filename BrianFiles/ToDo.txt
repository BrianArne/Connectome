TODO:

*** Highest Priority ***
  1) Make drop down selection for region pairs in chord diagram
  2) Recolor selected pairs from drop down in Surf Ice
  4) User interface to select .matlab file
  5) Clean up Connectome.py
    -Move button related things somewhere appropriate

*** Medium Priority ***
  1) Add edge in Surf Ice between node regions selected from drop down
  2) Determine how ipython (jupyter), plotly.FigureWidge, and Plotly.grah_obs work together
  3) New file format parsers
  4) Matlab scripts to generate files
  5) Extract Class from Chord Graph
    -Graph
    -Gui
  6) Load time for Plotly
    -Probably related to loading in full Plotly.js script @ runtime
  7) Error checking
    -Zero nodes selected for redraw
  8) Update testcases
  9) Do we want to redraw graph instead of creating another?

*** Low Priority ***
  1) Dependency manager to automatically load up dependencies
    -$pip -r requirements.txt (might do the trick)
  2) Add code coverage tool to see what has and hasn't been tested (Coverage.py)
  3) Move to Python 3.x
